What happened on Eterion will forever remain a mystery. The heroes returned to the city. The Elder Council congratulated them on their victory although they never learned what really happened. The existence of Eldralignum was confirmed by the heroes, who began to explore prehistoric knowledge. On the advice of the Elders, they went to the library, curious about what had been going on for the past years. Oxidium, Eldralignum, mystical artifacts. What are they, how many are there, and why did they suddenly began to appear despite the fact that no one had talked about them for centuries? Analyzing the books, the heroes discovered new valuable information: there are 6 mystical artifacts whose powers: energy, magic, life, water, time, darkness are locked in unknown objects. They are the ones who created the universe we live in. They are the ones responsible for chaos and balance, for light and darkness, good and evil. A long time ago, because of their powerful power, the guardian of the artifacts, sent them around the different universes, so that they would never be combined again. What happened then? The story remains unknown because some pages have been torn from the books. Something or someone does not want to share this information. Together, the heroes noticed a pattern - the artifacts began to reappear. Is this a coincidence? A wise man said: “Nothing happens by chance.” Suddenly something unusual began to happen in the library - where did the water come from? The water level was beginning to rise - in a library on a flat floor. This is impossible. The heroes ran outside the building and saw something they were not ready for. A big pirate ship was gliding toward them on a wave of water that physically shouldn't exist. The townspeople stood concerned as they watched the huge frigate sail into town. Suddenly, pirates began jumping out of the ship. They destroyed much in their path, separated into groups they looked like they were looking for something. The heroes set off after the robot to defend the city. After a long battle, they unfortunately lost. The pirates invaded their workshop. The heroes tried to resist, however, something was happening, the water began to attack them and suddenly the world melted away - they lost consciousness."

                            "description": "„The heroes woke up in a strange place. They found themselves in a room made of stone, and they could smell the moisture in it. Noise behind the stones like waves hitting the shore. This was definitely not their studio. They were in a prison. When they regained full consciousness they saw figures behind the bars that separated them from freedom. In front of them stood a man, with scars on his arms, wearing clothes resembling a uniform however a little different, with a big hat on his head. Welcome Heroes to Phantom Island! You have a unique opportunity to experience this place, because you will stay here for a very long time. We traveled a long way to find you. As soon as you returned to your city, you disappeared. Why don't you tell us where you were and what you were doing? - asked the mysterious figure. - It's none of your business, Captain. Who are you? - One of the Heroes asked. - Very good, you know who you are talking to. Yes, I am Captain Morgrimm - ruler of the Archipelago of Merciless Destiny. At the sound of Captain Morgrimm's name, the pirates standing nearby squirmed which the Heroes noticed. - You can see my power. Everyone is afraid of me. For years I fought to unite all countries under one ruler - mine! I dragged you here because you have information that may be useful to me. Have you heard the legend of the mystical artifacts? - continued Captain Morgrimm. - Yyyy no, and what is that? - replied another of the Heroes. - Hahaha, clever! I know that you know about them. You have already met three on your way! And even ... 4, saying this, he pulled out a shell from his pocket - a small one, but special. Something strange was felt from it, as if an unknown energy. You could see a glow coming from inside it. - This is the Shell of Destiny. It gave me power over everything. I turned lands into boundless oceans, brought chaos by sinking cities to restore balance under my rule! With this shell I can do everything - and yet I still lack something. There are places I can't get to. They are resistant to water therefore I need other solutions. I was hoping that the energy cubes from your machine (he shuddered) would help me solve the problem but the device we managed to get does not want to work with your devilry. Now it's your turn. If you run my machine I promise to let you go - the Pirate's word! I will wait for information on the ship. Don't do anything stupid, we're watching you, said the Captain then walked away leaving the Heroes with his guard. - Ha, great. Since our robot is here, we can use it. Before leaving from the library, I prepared it for action - just in case. If they didn't break anything, the robot is fully operational and ready to go. Have you noticed the strange behavior of the Captain? I think he is afraid of technology. If these are pirate times like here theeen this robot is a big novelty for him. Let's take advantage of it! - stated one of the Heroes. - What do you want to do? - they asked. - Reverse the action of the shell - said quietly someone in the room. It was one of the pirate guards. - This is the only way you will be able to defeat him. Without it, he will lose his power. And be careful, he is looking for artifacts. There was someone here some time ago. I don't know who, strangely enough, we found munchkins in the chamber. That someone gave him a task and threatened him with loss of power. Morgrimm was never so terrified as he was then... The heroes listened to the pirate's statement. Without thinking any longer they moved forward. They managed to defeat the guards and reach the robot. Fortunately, it was intact. After activation, everything began to function. Well ... then ... to ... work!"
