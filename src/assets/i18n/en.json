It was because of them that everything around us was created. The most important and powerful artifact was the Eldralignum, - the source of life in the entire universe. The legend, although considered by many to be fiction, speaks of a distant planet hidden deep in the depths of space, protected by an ancient race older than humanity itself. Its name is Eterion.",

The story goes that on Eterion there was a city whose inhabitants were engaged in the extraction of Eldralignum, and then distributed its energy throughout the universe in a way unknown to anyone. These themselves - while working at the same time protected their sacred place. There were also beings in the Universe who proclaimed that they had intercepted an unknown radio signal that contained scraps of information having to do with the legendary Eterion and Eldralignum. However, the signal was so complex that no machine could fully decode it.... It was therefore lost, after time. These people were more than once ridiculed and accused of preaching heresy.... No one believed in mystical life-giving energy...."

The castle, its inhabitants and its rulers survived and the magic returned. The Oxidium Stone, the source of the magic, was sealed and secured in a metal box so that no one would ever use it again. As they passed through the portal they noticed changes in nature. Maybe it was a temporary effect of the lack of oxidium? The heroes returned to Starlight City, tired but happy, as they were able to save more lives. However, not everything is as it was. Plants in the city are beginning to wither. Flowers, once lush, are drooping in the sunlight. Life begins to die, just as it did on Knight's planet. Could it be that Goruk's actions have spread further than thought? The heroes decided to seek the knowledge of the elders, the advice of Starlight City's greatest and wisest. Unfortunately, they were unable to give them a solution or a reason.  After a while, one of the elders stood up and said: “If vegetation dies then life fades away. If life fades then, although improbable, there is only one solution. Could it be that the legend is true?” - “What legend?” the characters ask. - “A story older than You and Us, and everything you know. The legend of the beginning of the universe and the mystical Eldralignum.” Surprise appeared on the faces of the heroes as well as the other members of the council of elders. - “Eterion doesn't exist, it's a fairy tale”. - said the elders. The council ended their discussions, returning to pondering and searching for scientific answers to the current crisis. Without life, there is nothing. The eldest turned to the heroes to try to learn as much as possible about Eterion. When they were walking toward the Council of the Eldest after a few days of searching, they saw a figure in the center of the city that was different from the usual one. However, it was not she who caught their attention. It was the object in the figure's hand. An energy cube of a color they hadn't seen before.- “Heroes, I have been waiting for you. It's time for us to go to a special place. We need your knowledge and help.” Suddenly a light flashed and everything disappeared."

The stranger introduced himself as Kolrak, the leader and guardian of the main nectar mining and production base. “Nectar? Could it be after all?” the heroes thought. “Welcome to Eterion. We have observed your achievements in your city and the land of the Knight and have decided that you are worthy to appear here. We need your help, as only your civilization has learned the secrets of this” - Saying this, Kolrak showed them an energy cube. “You use the same to power your city, we use a different, weaker version of the energy cube. Your knowledge is essential for us. Help us.” The heroes, already knowing the legend of Eldralignum and Eterion, did not hesitate and went into action.“Something unprecedented happened. Our factory suddenly stopped working. Eterion never had an interruption, something must have happened. The effects of the outage have already begun to be felt in your city and beyond. Without Eldralignum distributed throughout the universe, life is receding. We must act! This is your task.” This is phase I. You have to get to the reactor that powers our building and reactivate it. The radiation is too high, only your robot can do it. The reactor was protected by various defense systems. We managed to deactivate them however, the field defenses still remain. It can try to defeat or bypass them. In the meantime as you move around the base collect samples of crushed crystals, we need to know what suddenly happened. The more the better.  You can also get to the lever that will be able to turn on the reactor. The next task is to send a signal to headquarters to resume production. This will be done using those big antennas. To do this position them in the right direction. Use the lever for this. If you manage to complete these tasks then we will be able to restore the entire production system. Great job, the production is working. Now it's time to spread the energy throughout the universe. We need to connect to our moon, where we hid the nectar energy distribution mechanism. This is what we use the big transmitter for. Connect the cable so we can reactivate the transmitter and send data to it. If we want to transport energy, we need to hit the moment when the moon is in range of our planet! By connecting the cores you will increase the power and range of the signal which will give you a longer time window. Get to work heroes! The fate of the universe is in your hands. If you succeed, try to look for traces that will lead us to what happened here."
